# week-five-challenge-karenas

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to allow a team of users to manage project tasks by filtering them into one of three categories, not yet started, in progress and completed.

Functionality:
Users can add a task using the task form. Users can give the task a title, due date, and description. The new task will populate in the not-yet-started column and can be dragged to either the in-progress column or the completed column. Each task also comes with a delete button allowing the user to remove unwanted tasks, or those made in error.

Goals Accomplished:
Users are able to track the progress of tasks via the task list allowing for easy task management.
